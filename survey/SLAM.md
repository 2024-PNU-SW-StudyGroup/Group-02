# Survey Report for SLAM based autonomous Robots

## Introduction

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer vision. It is the process of creating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the robot's location within it. The SLAM problem has been studied extensively in the past few decades, and many different approaches have been proposed to solve it. In this survey, we will review some of the most popular SLAM algorithms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
